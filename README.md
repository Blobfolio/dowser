`Dowser` is a(nother) fast, recursive file-finding library for Unix/Rust. It differs from [`Walkdir`](https://crates.io/crates/walkdir) and kin in a number of ways:

* It is not limited to one root; any number of file and directory paths can be loaded and traversed en masse;
* Symlinks and hidden directories are followed like any other, including across devices;
* Matching file paths are canonicalized and deduped before yielding;

If those things sound nice, this library might be a good fit.

On the other hand, `Dowser` is optimized for _file_ searching; the iterator crawls but does not yield directory paths.

Additionally, path deduping relies on Unix metadata; **this library is not compatible with Windows**;

Depending on your needs, those limitations could be bad, in which case something like [`Walkdir`](https://crates.io/crates/walkdir) would make more sense.



## Installation

Add `dowser` to your `dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`, like:

```
[dependencies]
dowser = "0.6.*"
```



## Example

All you need to do is chain `Dowser::default` with one or more of the following seed methods:

* `Dowser::with_path` / `Dowser::with_paths`
* `Dowser::without_path` / `Dowser::without_paths`

From there, you can use whatever `Iterator` methods you want.

```rust
use dowser::Dowser;
use std::path::PathBuf;

// Return all files under "/usr/share/man".
let files: Vec::<PathBuf> = Dowser::default()
    .with_path("/usr/share/man")
    .collect();

// Return only Gzipped files using callback filter.
let files: Vec::<PathBuf> = Dowser::default()
    .with_path("/usr/share/man")
    .filter(|p|
        p.extension().map_or(
            false,
            |e| e.eq_ignore_ascii_case("gz")
        )
    )
    .collect();
```
