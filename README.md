# Dowser

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/dowser.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/dowser)

[`Dowser`] is a(nother) fast, multi-threaded, recursive file-finding library for Unix/Rust. It differs from [`Walkdir`](https://crates.io/crates/walkdir) and kin in a number of ways:

 * It is not limited to one root; any number of file and directory paths can be loaded and traversed en masse;
 * Symlinks and hidden directories are followed like any other, including across devices;
 * Matching file paths are canonicalized, deduped, and collected into a `Vec<PathBuf>`;

If those things sound nice, this library might be a good fit.

On the other hand, [`Dowser`] is optimized for just one particular type of searching:

 * Aside from [`Dowser::with_filter`] and [`Dowser::with_regex`], there is no way to alter its traversal behaviors;
 * There are no settings for things like min/max depth, directory filtering, etc.;
 * It only returns *file* paths. Directories are crawled, but not returned in the set;
 * File uniqueness hashing relies on Unix metadata; **this library is not compatible with Windows**;

Depending on your needs, those limitations could be bad, in which case something like [`Walkdir`](https://crates.io/crates/walkdir) might make more sense.



## Installation

Add `dowser` to your `dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`, like:

```
[dependencies]
dowser = "0.1.*"
```



## Features

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `regexp` | Enable the [`Dowser::with_regex`] method, which allows for matching file paths (as bytes) against a regular expression. |

To use this feature, alter the `Cargo.toml` bit to read:

```
[dependencies.dowser]
version = "0.1.*"
features = [ "regexp" ]
```



## Example

This crate comes with two ways to find files. If you already have the full list of starting path(s) and just want *all the files* that exist under them, use the [`dowse`] method:

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;

let paths = [ "/path/one", "/path/two", "/path/three" ];
let files: Vec<PathBuf> = dowser::dowse(&paths);
```

If you need to load starting paths multiple times, or want to filter the results, you can use the full [`Dowser`] struct instead. It follows a basic builder pattern, so you can just chain your way to an answer:

```rust
use dowser::Dowser;
use std::{
    os::unix::ffi::OsStrExt,
    path::{Path, PathBuf},
};

// Return all files under "/usr/share/man".
let res: Vec<PathBuf> = Dowser::default()
    .with_path("/usr/share/man")
    .build();

// Return only Gzipped files, using a regular expression.
// This requires the "regexp" feature.
let res: Vec<PathBuf> = Dowser::default()
    .with_regex(r"(?i)[^/]+\.gz$") // Filter before adding paths!
    .with_path("/usr/share/man")
    .build();

// The same thing, done manually.
let res: Vec<PathBuf> = Dowser::default()
    .with_filter(|p: &Path| p.extension()
        .map_or(
            false,
            |e| e.as_bytes().eq_ignore_ascii_case(b"gz")
        )
    ) // Again, filter before adding paths!
    .with_path("/usr/share/man")
    .build();
```

If you want to easily bubble an error in cases where no files are found, you can use the [`std::convert::TryFrom`] trait (instead of calling [`Dowser::build`]), like:

```rust
use dowser::Dowser;
use std::convert::TryFrom;

let out = Vec::<PathBuf>::try_from(
    Dowser::default().with_path("/usr/share/man")
)
    .map_err(|_| YourErrorHere)?;
```
